# Resistance Measuring
Resistance is measured in ohms.

## Measuring resistance
Two measurements that often come up are zero and OL (overload). 
A measurement of zero or very close to zero (less than 0.5 ohms) indicates a very low resistance to current flow. Applying voltage to this low level of resistance will result in extremely high current flow.

 if your circuit is continuous, the screen displays a value of zero (or near zero), and the multimeter beeps. If the screen displays 1 or OL (open loop), there's no continuityâ€”that is, there's no path for electric current to flow from one probe to the other.
 
 Resistance is measured in ohms with no current flowing through the circuit.
It indicates zero ohms when there is no resistance between the test points. This shows continuity of current flow in a closed circuit. It indicates infinity when there are no connections in the circuit that is as in an open circuit.
