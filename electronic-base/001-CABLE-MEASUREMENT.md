# Cable

## Test a Cable connection with tester

1) Enable the tester on Ohm configuration

If your circuit is continuous, the screen displays a value of zero (or near zero), and the multimeter beeps ( based on multimeter configuration). 
If the screen displays 1 or OL (open loop), there's no continuityâ€”that is, there's no path for electric current to flow from one probe to the other.
 
2) 0.L -> Cable not connected (OVERLOAD)
